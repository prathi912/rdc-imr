## 1. Faculty (Standard User)
This is the base role for all teaching and research staff.

### Profile & Settings
1.  **First-Time Login (Profile Setup):**
    -   On your first login, you will be guided to the **Profile Setup** page. This is a critical and mandatory step.
    -   You can pre-fill your academic details by entering your MIS ID and clicking "Fetch My Details". Review the information for accuracy.
    -   Upload a professional profile picture.
    -   Complete all required fields, including your Campus, Faculty, Institute, Department, and Designation.

2.  **Settings Page:**
    -   Navigate to **Settings** from the sidebar at any time to update your profile.
    -   **Crucially, you must complete your salary bank account details**. This information is required for any grant disbursal or incentive claim. The portal will not allow you to submit projects until this is complete.
    -   You can also update your researcher IDs (ORCID, Scopus, etc.) and change your password from this page.

### IMR Workflow (Intramural Research)
1.  **New Project Submission:**
    -   Navigate to **New Submission** from the sidebar.
    -   The submission form is divided into four steps:
        1.  **Project Details:** Enter the title, abstract, and category. Align your project with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
        2.  **Team Info:** Upload your CV. Add Co-PIs by searching for their MIS ID; they must be registered. For each Co-PI, you must upload their CV. List any student members involved.
        3.  **File Uploads:** Upload your main Project Proposal (PDF) and, if applicable, your Ethics Approval document (PDF).
        4.  **Timeline & Outcomes:** Detail the project timeline and the expected outcomes or impact.
    -   At any step, click **Save as Draft**. Drafts are accessible from the **My Projects** page to be completed later.
    -   On the final step, you must agree to the guidelines before the "Submit Project" button becomes active.

2.  **Project Tracking ("My Projects" Page):**
    -   Go to the **My Projects** page to view all IMR projects you are associated with.
    -   Monitor the project status: `Draft`, `Submitted`, `Under Review`, `Revision Needed`, `Recommended`, `Not Recommended`, `In Progress`, `Pending Completion Approval`, `Completed`. Each status change will trigger a notification.

### EMR Workflow (Extramural Research)
1.  **Browse Opportunities:** Navigate to the **EMR Calendar** to view all available external funding calls.

3.  **Await Meeting Schedule:** An administrator will schedule presentation slots. You will be notified via email and in-app notification.
4.  **Upload Presentation:** Once scheduled, you must upload your presentation (PPT/PPTX) before the hard deadline, which is **2 days prior to your presentation date at 5:00 PM**.
5.  **Manage Uploads:** Before the deadline, you can view, replace, or remove your uploaded presentation from your application card on the calendar page.

(CRO, Principal, Head of Department)

These roles provide a hierarchical, read-only oversight of the research activities within their specific scope.

## 4. Admin & Super-admin
These roles have the highest level of access for managing the entire portal.

### Core Management Tasks
-   **IMR Meeting Scheduling:** From **Schedule Meeting**, select submitted projects, set a date/time/venue, and assign an evaluation committee. The system automates all notifications.

### System Administration
-   **User Management:** From **Manage Users**, assign roles (Faculty, Evaluator, CRO, Admin) to users. For CROs, you can assign them to specific faculties.
-   **Bulk Data Management:** Use the **Bulk Upload** modules to import historical project, publication, or incentive data from formatted Excel files.
-   **System Health:** The **System Health** dashboard allows you to monitor the connectivity and status of all integrated Firebase services.
-   **Module Management (Super-admin only):** A powerful feature to dynamically grant or revoke access to any part of the portal (e.g., "Manage Users") for any user, providing fine-grained permission control beyond the default roles.

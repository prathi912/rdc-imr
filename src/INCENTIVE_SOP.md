    -   **Important**: Use the **Auto-fill** features (e.g., "Fetch from Scopus/WoS") whenever available to ensure data accuracy and faster processing.
4.  **Save or Submit**:
    -   You can click **Save as Draft** at any point to save your progress. Drafts can be accessed and completed later from the "Drafts" tab.
    -   Once all information is complete, click **Proceed to Review** to verify your details, and then **Submit Claim** to send it for approval.

## 2. Managing Co-Authors

For collaborative works like research papers and books, it is essential to add all authors accurately. The system uses this information to calculate incentive distribution as per the university's policy.

### How to Add Co-Authors:
The primary author submitting the claim is responsible for adding all other authors.

1.  **Search for Internal Authors**:
    -   For co-authors who are part of Parul University, use the **"Add Internal Co-Author"** search box.
    -   You can search by the author's **Name** or **MIS ID**.
    -   If the user is found, click **"Add"** to include them in the author list. The system will automatically link their profile.

2.  **Add External Authors**:
    -   For co-authors who are **not** from Parul University, use the **"Add External Co-Author"** section.
    -   You must provide their full **Name** and a valid **Email Address**.
    -   Assign them the role of "Co-Author".

3.  **Assign Roles**:
    -   For each author added, you must assign their correct role (e.g., First Author, Corresponding Author, Co-Author) using the dropdown menu next to their name.
    -   **Policy Reminder**: As per policy, there can only be **one** First Author and **one** Corresponding Author. If two authors share the role, please designate one as "First & Corresponding Author".

**Crucial Directive**: It is mandatory to declare all authors on the publication. Failure to list all co-authors accurately may lead to the rejection of your claim.

## 3. Claim-Specific Instructions

### A. Research Papers
-   **Auto-fill Data**: Use the **"Fetch from..."** buttons (Scopus, WoS ) by providing a DOI or URL. This will pre-fill most of the required information.
-   **Author Roles**: Accurately set your role and the roles of all co-authors. This directly impacts the incentive calculation.
-   **PU Name**: You must confirm if "Parul University" is mentioned in the publication's affiliation. If not, the incentive is reduced by 50%.
-   **APC Payment**: Declare if the Article Processing Charge (APC) was paid by the university, as this also reduces the incentive by 50%.

### B. Patents
-   **Applicant**: You must specify if Parul University is the Sole Applicant or a Joint Applicant. No incentive is provided if PU is not an applicant.
-   **Inventors**: Add all inventors (faculty and students) involved in the patent. The incentive is distributed equally among all of them.
-   **Status**: Select the current status (Filed, Published, or Granted) as the incentive amount depends on it.

### C. Books & Book Chapters
-   **Application Type**: Clearly distinguish between a full "Book" and a "Book Chapter".
-   **Author Role**: Specify if your role was "Author" or "Editor", as this affects the incentive amount.
-   **Multiple Chapters**: If you have authored multiple chapters in the same book, you must create a **separate claim for each chapter**. The system will automatically cap the total incentive at the amount for publishing a full book.

### D. Conference Presentations
-   **Mode of Conference**: The reimbursement amount differs significantly for "Online" vs. "Offline" events.
-   **Online Presentations**: You must specify if it is your First, Second, Third, or an Additional online presentation in the calendar year, as the reimbursement percentage changes.
-   **Offline (Outside India)**: It is **mandatory** to provide proof that you first requested a travel grant from a government funding agency.

### E. Seed Money for APC
-   **Waiver Request**: It is **mandatory** to provide proof that you first requested an APC waiver from the publisher. Your claim will not be processed without this.
-   **PU Authors**: The reimbursement is distributed equally among all internal (PU) authors of the paper.

### F. Membership of Professional Bodies
-   **Frequency**: A faculty member can only claim this incentive **once per calendar year**.
-   **Amount**: The incentive is 50% of the membership fee paid, capped at a maximum of ₹10,000.

## 4. Tracking Your Claims

-   **My Claims**: This tab shows the status of all claims you have personally submitted.
-   **Co-Author Claims**: This tab appears if a primary author has submitted a claim and listed you as a co-author. You must go here and click **"View & Apply"** to submit your individual claim for your share of the incentive. Your claim will not be processed until you do so.
-   **Drafts**: Access and continue any claims you have saved as a draft.

For further details on the specific calculation logic for each category, please refer to the official **[Research Incentive Policy](INCENTIVE_POLICY.md)** document.

### Profile & Settings
1.  **First-Time Login (Profile Setup):**
    -   On your first login, you will be guided to the **Profile Setup** page. This is a critical and mandatory step.
    -   You can pre-fill your academic details by entering your MIS ID and clicking "Fetch My Details". Review the information for accuracy.

    -   Complete all required fields, including your Campus, Faculty, Institute, Department, and Designation.

2.  **Settings Page:**
    -   Navigate to **Settings** from the sidebar at any time to update your profile.

    -   You can also update your researcher IDs (ORCID, Scopus, etc.) and change your password from this page.

### IMR Workflow (Intramural Research)
1.  **New Project Submission:**
    -   Navigate to **New Submission** from the sidebar.
    -   The submission form is divided into four steps:

    -   On the final step, you must agree to the guidelines before the "Submit Project" button becomes active.

2.  **Project Tracking ("My Projects" Page):**
    -   Go to the **My Projects** page to view a list of all IMR projects you are associated with (either as a Principal Investigator or a Co-PI).
    -   Monitor the status of your projects. The statuses mean:
        -   `Draft`: You have saved the project but not yet submitted it. You can still edit it.
        -   `Submitted`: Your project has been submitted and is awaiting review scheduling.
        -   `Under Review`: An evaluation meeting has been scheduled. You will be notified of the date, time, and venue.

        -   `Recommended`: Your project has been approved for funding.
        -   `Not Recommended`: Your project was not approved for funding.
        -   `In Progress`: The project grant has been awarded and the project is active.

# Research & Development Portal - Parul University

This is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to streamline and manage the entire research lifecycle at Parul University. It serves as a central hub for faculty, evaluators, and administrators to handle Intramural (IMR) and Extramural (EMR) research projects, user management, and grant tracking.

The portal is built with a modern tech stack, leveraging the power of Next.js for the frontend and backend, Firebase for its powerful suite of backend services, and Google's Genkit for integrating cutting-edge AI features.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The portal provides a tailored experience for each user role, ensuring users only see what's relevant to them.
-   **Faculty:** The primary users of the portal. They can submit and track their own research projects, manage their public profile including a list of their publications, and register for external funding calls.
-   **Evaluators:** Assigned to review project proposals. They have access to a dedicated queue of projects assigned for review, can use AI-assisted tools for scoring, and submit structured feedback.
-   **CRO (Chief Research Officer):** Have oversight of all projects within their specific faculty. They can manage user roles, schedule meetings, and access faculty-specific analytics.
-   **Admin:** Have broad oversight of the entire system, including user management, project status updates, and system monitoring.
-   **Super-admin:** Has complete control over the entire system, including all admin privileges plus the ability to dynamically manage module access for all other users.

### 2. Intramural Research (IMR) Project Management
A complete workflow for managing internal research project funding from submission to completion.
-   **Guided Proposal Submission:** A multi-step form for submitting detailed project proposals, including team information, abstracts, and necessary file uploads (proposal PDF, team CVs, ethics approvals).
-   **Status Tracking:** Real-time tracking of project status (Draft, Submitted, Under Review, Recommended, Not Recommended, In Progress, Completed, etc.).
-   **AI-Assisted Evaluation:** AI-generated prompts to help evaluators assess projects based on key criteria like relevance, methodology, feasibility, and innovation.
-   **Meeting Scheduling:** Admins and CROs can schedule IMR evaluation meetings for multiple submitted projects at once and automatically notify the Principal Investigators (PIs) via email.
-   **Grant Management:** A system for awarding grants, tracking fund utilization through transaction logging, and managing the disbursement process in phases.

### 3. Extramural Research (EMR) Management
A dedicated module to manage the lifecycle of externally funded research opportunities.
-   **EMR Calendar:** A central calendar listing all available external funding calls, complete with deadlines and details.
-   **Interest Registration:** Faculty can register their interest in a call and add Co-PIs to their team directly through the portal.
-   **Presentation Workflow:** A streamlined process for scheduling presentation slots, assigning evaluators, and allowing faculty to upload their presentation files before a hard deadline.
-   **Admin Oversight:** Super-admins can manage the entire EMR lifecycle, from adding new funding calls to tracking evaluation outcomes.

### 4. User Profiles & Publication Tracking
-   **Public Profiles:** Faculty can maintain a public-facing profile showcasing their research contributions, projects, and a comprehensive list of their publications.
-   **Publication Management:** A dedicated system for faculty to add, edit, and delete their research papers. The system intelligently handles co-authors, ensuring a single paper entry appears on the profiles of all its authors to reduce data redundancy.
-   **Automated Co-Author Linking:** When adding a paper, the system automatically checks for existing users or staff members by their university email, linking profiles and fetching names to streamline the process.

### 5. AI Integration (Powered by Google Genkit)
-   **Project Summarization:** Instantly generate concise summaries of complex project proposals to aid in quick reviews.
-   **Research Domain Suggestion:** AI analyzes a faculty member's publication history to suggest their core research domain for their public profile.
-   **Journal Website Finder:** An AI tool to find the official website of an academic journal based on its name, helping to verify publication sources.

### 6. System Administration
-   **User Management:** Admins can manage user roles and permissions, including assigning CROs to specific faculties.
-   **Module Management:** A Super-admin exclusive feature to dynamically assign access to different parts of the portal for each user.
-   **System Health Dashboard:** A dedicated page to monitor the connectivity and status of all integrated Firebase services (Firestore, Auth, Storage) in real-time.
-   **Bulk Data Upload:** Admins can upload historical project data from a formatted Excel file to integrate past records into the system.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later)
-   `npm` (comes with Node.js)
-   A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

This is the most critical step. The application will not run without the correct environment variables.

1.  Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
2.  Copy the contents of the `.env` file into your new `.env.local` file.
3.  Fill in the values for each variable as described below.

#### Firebase Client-Side Keys
-   Go to your **Firebase Console** -> **Project Settings** (gear icon) -> **General**.
-   Under "Your apps", find your web app and copy the `firebaseConfig` object values.

```env
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API="[API_KEY]"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="[AUTH_DOMAIN]"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="[PROJECT_ID]"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="[STORAGE_BUCKET]"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="[MESSAGING_SENDER_ID]"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="[APP_ID]"
```

#### Firebase Admin (Server-Side) Keys
-   Go to your **Firebase Console** -> **Project Settings** -> **Service accounts**.
-   Click **"Generate new private key"**. A JSON file will be downloaded.
-   Open the JSON file and copy the corresponding values.

```env
# .env.local
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="[client_email_from_json]"
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="[private_key_from_json]"
```

#### Email Service (Nodemailer)
-   You'll need a Gmail account and an "App Password".
-   Go to your **Google Account** -> **Security** -> **2-Step Verification** (must be enabled).
-   Go to **App passwords**, create a new password for this app, and copy the 16-character password.

```env
# .env.local
GMAIL_USER="your-gmail-address@gmail.com"
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="your-16-character-app-password"
```

#### Optional API Keys
-   These are needed for fetching data from external academic sources. The application will function without them, but some features will be disabled.

```env
# .env.local
SCOPUS_API_KEY=""
WOS_API_KEY=""
SPRINGER_API_KEY=""
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Once your `.env.local` file is configured, you can start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

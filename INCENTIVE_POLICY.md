## 1. Research Papers

The incentive for research papers is determined by a base amount, which is then adjusted based on publication type and author distribution.

### Base Incentive Amount

The base amount depends on the faculty member's designation and their faculty's category.

**PhD Scholars:**
Incentives are only provided for high-quartile publications.
- **Q1 Journal:** ₹6,000
- **Q2 Journal:** ₹4,000
- **Q3, Q4, or other:** ₹0

**Category 'A' Faculties:**
This special policy applies to faculty from specific science and technology-related disciplines.
- **Nature/Science/Lancet:** ₹50,000
- **Top 1% Journals:** ₹25,000
- **Q1 Journal (Scopus/WoS):** ₹15,000
- **Q2 Journal (Scopus/WoS):** ₹10,000
- **Q3 Journal (Scopus/WoS):** ₹6,000
- **Q4 Journal (Scopus/WoS):** ₹4,000

**All Other Faculties (Non-Category 'A'):**
Incentives are based on a broader range of indexing criteria.
- **Scopus/WoS (Q1-Q4):** Same as Category 'A' (e.g., Q1 is ₹15,000).
- **WoS (SCIE, SSCI, A&HCI):** ₹3,000
- **UGC-CARE Group-I:** ₹1,000
- **Scopus Indexed Conference Proceedings:** ₹3,000

### Adjustments to Base Amount

1.  **Publication Type Adjustment:**
    - **Research Articles / Short Communications:** 100% of base amount.
    - **Scopus Indexed Conference Proceedings:** Flat ₹3,000 (not subject to further adjustments other than author share).
    - **Case Reports / Short Surveys:** 90% of base amount.
    - **Review Articles (Q3/Q4):** 80% of base amount. (Q1/Q2 review articles get 100%).
    - **Letter to the Editor/Editorial:** Flat total of ₹2,500 to be distributed among all authors.

2.  **Affiliation & APC Payment:**
    - If "Parul University" is **not** mentioned in the publication affiliation, the final incentive is **reduced by 50%**.
    - If the Article Processing Charge (APC) was paid by the University, the final incentive is **reduced by 50%**.

### Author Distribution Rules

The adjusted total incentive is distributed among PU authors based on their roles.

- **Rule 1 (Sole Author):** If there is only one internal author (as First or Corresponding Author), they receive **100%** of the total incentive.
- **Rule 2 (Sole Co-Author):** If there is only one internal author (as Co-Author), they receive **80%** of the total incentive.
- **Rule 3 (Multiple Co-Authors Only):** If there are multiple internal Co-Authors (and no internal First/Corresponding), **80%** of the total incentive is distributed equally among them.
- **Rule 4 (Mixed Roles):** If there are internal First/Corresponding Authors AND internal Co-Authors:
  - **70%** of the total incentive is distributed equally among the First/Corresponding Authors.
  - **30%** of the total incentive is distributed equally among the Co-Authors.
